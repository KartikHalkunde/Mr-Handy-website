(install git first duhh)
to install git write this in your command prompt winget install Git.Git : this will install git in your windows pc 
        if you have arch like me write this in your terminal -> sudo pacman -S git
open your terminal/command prompt and write -> git clone https://github.com/KartikHalkunde/Mr-Handy-website.git : this will clone this repo in whatever path you are in..

then open this cloned repo in your vs code or cursor
in the terminal write npm install (then) npm run dev (then) control click on the localhost link..  AND ENJOY THE FRUITS OF MY UNPAID LABOUR :`)
